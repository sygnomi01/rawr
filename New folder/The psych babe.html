            Your diploma isn't just a piece of paper you can randomly toss and joke about, Psychology is a course about understanding people, the mind, and youâ€“ Yes, you. The very person reading this, to understand the mind, and to understand people, you must first understand yourself.

            Studying the mind is hard, that's a given. The 1st few years are quite 'chill' per say (That is to say, you didn't join any organization in college).

But that will be far more lighter than the rest of your years ahead (Generally speaking, 1st year for any freshmen IS the easiest year.)
